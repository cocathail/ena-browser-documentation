How to Cite Data in ENA
=======================

In all cases, the top-level Project accession should be cited as well as a link to where the data can be found in the
browser, for example:

*“the data for this study have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at EMBL-EBI under*
*accession number PRJEBxxxx (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEBxxxx).”*

If there is a particular scenario where using the top level accession would not be suitable, for example, if you have
multiple publications that reference individual components within a single ENA project (and therefore the project
accession provides too much ambiguity), then the following accessions are also considered accessions that could
be used for publication:

- Assemblies (e.g. format GCA_123456789.1)
- BioSamples in the context of associated data (e.g. format SAMEA123456)
- Assembled/Annotated Sequences including contig, scaffold and chromosome sequences generated from an assembly
  submission (e.g. format A12345.1)

All accessions issued by ENA, along with all accessions issued by its international partner institutions under
INSDC, can be viewed in the ENA browser by pasting the accession into the Text search box or through the URL:
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/<accession>

*e.g. http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/BN000065*

Numeric ranges for accessions with the same prefix are also supported via
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/<accession1>-<accession2>

*e.g. http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/BN000066-BN000070*
