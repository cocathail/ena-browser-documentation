How to Cite Data in ENA
=======================

In all cases, the top-level Project accession should be cited as well as a link to where the data can be found in the
browser, for example:

*“the data for this study have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at EMBL-EBI under*
*accession number PRJEBxxxx (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEBxxxx).”*

If there is a particular scenario where using the top level accession would not be suitable, for example, if you have
multiple publications that reference individual components within a single ENA project (and therefore the project
accession provides too much ambiguity), then the following accessions are also considered accessions that could
be used for publication:

- Assemblies (e.g. format GCA_123456789.1)
- BioSamples in the context of associated data (e.g. format SAMEA123456)
- Assembled/Annotated Sequences including contig, scaffold and chromosome sequences generated from an assembly
  submission (e.g. format A12345.1)

All accessions issued by ENA, along with all accessions issued by its international partner institutions under
INSDC, can be viewed in the ENA browser by pasting the accession into the Text search box or through the URL:
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/<accession>

*e.g. http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/BN000065*

Numeric ranges for accessions with the same prefix are also supported via
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/<accession1>-<accession2>

*e.g. http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/BN000066-BN000070*

ORCID Data Claiming
===================
The ORCID system (https://orcid.org/) will be familiar to many as a way to claim publications, grants and other types of contributions against an ID that is unique to you.

ENA studies/projects can now be claimed against your ORCID ID, in the same way that publications can. This is implemented through the EBI search interface : https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/orcidclaimdocumentation.ebi

To claim your data, simply search in the ‘ENA Study’ search box using accession numbers or keywords to find your project(s). This will return a list of results for your review. To claim projects, select the relevant checkboxes and click ‘Claim to ORCID’ at the top of the search results. This will prompt you to log in to your ORCID account, if you haven’t already done so.
