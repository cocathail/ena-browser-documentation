Data Coordination
=================

We provide focused support for scientific projects and initiatives through our Data Coordination programme, in which
we collaborate with partners across and beyond the life sciences to support the application of molecular methods.
Addressing the challenges of data-intensive methods, interdisciplinary science, multi-omics and complex and deep
data, we typically provide web and programmatic platforms for data sharing and publication, comprising tools,
analysis support, cloud compute accessibility, data navigation and visualisation systems and user training and
support.

Our Current Data Coordination Projects Include:
===============================================

- `European COVID-19 Data Platform <https://www.covid19dataportal.org/>`_

- `Pathogen epidemiology <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/pathogens/home>`_

- Marine science such as `Tara Oceans <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/news/press-releases/tara-oceans-data>`_ and `Ocean Sampling Day <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB5129>`_, `AtlantECO <https://www.atlanteco.eu/>`_ and `BlueCloud <https://blue-cloud.org/>`_

- `European sequencing facility access <https://www.easi-genomics.eu/home>`_ 

- `Investigating the lifelong effects of early life stress on health <https://earlycause.europescience.eu/>`_

-  Improving taxonomy and service linking through `a universal taxonomic framework for Eukaryotic organisms <https://unieuk.org/2017/11/09/eukbank-we-need-you/>`_ as well as efforts to `link sequences to taxonomies and natural history collections <https://bicikl-project.eu/>`_

- Offering data coordination support for projects generating biodiversity reference genomes including `Darwin Tree of Life <https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/>`_,  `Aquatic Symbiosis Genomics <https://www.aquaticsymbiosisgenomics.org/>`_ and `Biodiversity Genomics Europe <https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/>`_
