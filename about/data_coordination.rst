Data Coordination
=================

We provide focused support for scientific projects and initiatives through our Data Coordination programme,
in which we collaborate with partners across and beyond the life sciences to support the application of
molecular methods.

As part of our work addressing the challenges of data-intensive methods, interdisciplinary science, multi-omics
and complex and deep data, we typically provide web and programmatic platforms for:

- Data sharing and publication
- Analysis support
- Cloud compute accessibility
- Data navigation and visualisation systems

We also provide user training and support.
