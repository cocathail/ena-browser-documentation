===================
Reporting standards
===================

Harmonization of data and metadata collection becomes an essential effort in the age when data generation is often
easier and more affordable then their organization and storage.

Compliance of submitted data to the relevant reporting standards promotes:

- consistent and adequate data description
- thorough data validation
- data discoverability
- data reproducibility
- data interoperability and usability

ENA/INSDC reporting standards
=============================

The European Nucleotide Archive requires, where appropriate, use of the following reporting standards:

- `Feature Table <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/WebFeat/>`_ – Description of nucleotide sequence provenance and functional
  annotation of nucleotide sequence domains.

- `Third Party Data <>`_ – Guidelines for submission of assembly and/or annotation or existing INSDC reads and
  primary sequences by a third party.

- `Missing values <>`_ - Guidelines for registering metadata which is missing or restricted access.

Community-developed reporting standards
=======================================

The European Nucleotide Archive supports use of many community-developed reporting standards in the form of sample
checklists. Sample checklists are a defined set of minimum information required and validated during ENA sample
registration. Sample checklists have been developed with different research communities and allow data submission to
abide by different community-developed standards.

The full list can be viewed and explored `here <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/checklists>`_.

As part of our community engagement and standards development, the European Nucleotide Archive has a long-standing
collaboration with the `Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) <http://gensc.org/>`_. The GSC is an initiative of experts
building or using genome collections and developing standards for harmonised metadata collection and analysis
efforts across the wider genomics community.

The GSC supports a range of projects spanning sequencing projects, development of ontologies, metadata standards,
software tools or data formats. Minimum information about any (x) nucleotide sequence
(MIxS, `Yilmaz et al, 2011 <http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v29/n5/full/nbt.1823.html>`_) is
the core GSC standard consisting of checklists for describing genomes (MIGS), metagenomes (MIMS) and marker
sequences (MIMARKS).

Rad more information on the MIxS checklists `here <>`_.

Specialised databases
=====================

Submitters may also wish to submit to ENA after submitting to the following specialised databases:

- IPD-IMGT/HLA – For Human Leukocyte Antigen sequences, overseen by the WHO HLA Nomenclature Committee

- IPD-MHC – For non-Human Major Histocompatibility Complex sequences, overseen by Comparative MHC Nomenclature Committee

- IPD-KIR – For Human Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor sequences
