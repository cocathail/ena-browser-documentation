Upcoming Training Workshops
===========================

ENA contributes to various EBI training courses throughout the year.
These are a fantastic opportunity to learn about a range of topics in Bioinformatics, and get some hands-on experience
of using ENA submission and retrieval services.
Additionally, if you are planning a course and would like to invite ENA to contribute to it, please make a ticket with
our `support form <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/support>`_ and the appropriate member of our team will get back to
you.
