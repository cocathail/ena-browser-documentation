Sample Checklists
=================

Introduction
============

There is a minimum amount of information required during ENA sample registration and all samples must conform to
a defined checklist of expected metadata values. The most suitable checklist for sample registration depends on
the type of the sample.

Standards
=========

These sample checklists have been developed to meet the needs of different research communities. Different
communities have different requirements on the minimum metadata expected to describe biological samples.
