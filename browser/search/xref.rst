Cross Reference Search
======================

Introduction
============

The ENA Xref service holds cross-references to a number of external data resources
linked to ENA records. These cross-reference sources include both services operated by colleagues
at EMBL-EBI (such as `UniProt <http://www.uniprot.org/>`_ and `Ensembl <http://www.ensembl.org/>`_)
as well as those operated outside EMBL-EBI (including `SILVA <http://www.arb-silva.de/>`_
and `RFAM <http://rfam.xfam.org/>`_).

The update and frequency of each source is dependent on their own release cycle and/or
internal processes, with ENA supporting updates as frequently as once a week.

These cross-references can also be explored programmatically using the
`Xref API <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/xref/rest/>`_.

*If you would be interested in registering your resource as part of our cross-reference
service, you can request to be added as a new Xref source*
`here <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UHGQRHXoIbEL1nNaTt1dYzVGwY1v6BIlcPWQ03S5j9U>`_
*and a member of the team will get into contact with you to discuss your eligibility.*

Xref Sources
============

A cross-reference source is the external data source that has been registered as a
cross-reference within ENA. For more information on the available cross-reference sources,
see the Source Details tab.

Xref Targets
============

A cross-reference target is the ENA data type which the external cross-reference is associated
with. Current ENA targets:

- analysis
- assembly
- coding
- experiment
- noncoding
- run
- sample
- sequence
- study
- taxon
- trace
- wgsmaster

Expanded View
=============

In some cases, the external data source will have provided additional useful information,
you can choose to display this additional information by selecting the 'Expanded' view.

Search for Xrefs by ENA record
==============================

Return all cross-references associated with an ENA record by searching using the INSDC
accession.
