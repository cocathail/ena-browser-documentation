SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) Submissions
========================================================================

Please see below for instructions on how to submit SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) data. If you have any queries or require assistance with your submission please contact us at: virus-dataflow@ebi.ac.uk.

Registering Studies
===================
Data submissions to the ENA require that you register a study to contextualise and group your data. Details of how to do this can be found here: https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/study.html.
Please ensure you describe your study adequately, as well as provide an informative title.

Registering Samples
===================
Having registered a study, please proceed to register your samples. Instructions for sample registration are found here: https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/samples.html. As part of this process, you must select a sample checklist to describe metadata. The most appropriate checklist for Coronavirus submissions is the “ENA virus pathogen reporting standard checklist”. The attributes available in this checklist can be viewed here: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERC000033.
Please use the organism name “Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2”, the taxonomic ID 2697049 and please also provide a geographical location (as precise as possible).

Submitting Reads
================
After registering your study and samples, you can submit your read files along with experimental metadata. Instructions to submit reads are found here:
https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/reads.html.

Submitting Assemblies
=====================
If submitting assemblies, you must have registered a study and a sample beforehand. It is also advised that associated read data is also submitted. Instructions for assembly submission are found here: https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/assembly.html.

Submitting Targeted Sequences
=============================
If submitting targeted or annotated sequences, you must register a study as described above. Instructions for submitting sequence data are found here: https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/sequence.html. As part of this process, if submitting annotated sequences, you must select an annotation checklist, found here: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/annotation-checklists. There are several virus-specific annotation checklists, with “Single Viral CDS” the most appropriate for complete or partial coding sequence from a viral gene. If your sequences do not fit the annotation checklists above please contact us at virus-dataflow@ebi.ac.uk.

If submitting single contig assemblies, or for any other support or issues around SARS-CoV-2 submissions please contact virus-dataflow@ebi.ac.uk.

Release of Data
===============
Users are responsible for releasing data they submit to ENA. This is done by setting an appropriate release date, as detailed here:
